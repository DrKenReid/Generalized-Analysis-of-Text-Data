# 📊 Generalized Analysis of Text Data

## 🔍 Overview
This repo provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing text data using various AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It's designed to be a reference guide and inspiration for text analysis projects, offering insights into themes, sentiment, named entities, and more.

## ✨ Features
- **📥 Data Collection**: Uses the 20 Newsgroups dataset for demonstration.
- **📝 Initial Textual Analysis**: Performs basic text statistics and word frequency analysis.
- **🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes key aspects of the text data.
- **🗂️ Topic Modeling**: Uncovers hidden thematic structures in the text corpus.
- **🧩 Text Clustering**: Groups similar documents using K-means clustering.
- **🔤 Word Embeddings**: Captures semantic relationships between words using Word2Vec.
- **🔗 Document Similarity**: Identifies related documents using cosine similarity.
- **🏷️ Named Entity Recognition**: Extracts and classifies named entities in the text.
- **🕸️ Topic Network Visualization**: Visualizes relationships between topics and words.
- **😊 Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of the text.
- **📚 Text Classification**: Automatically categorizes texts using machine learning.
- **📝 Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of longer texts.
- **🔠 POS Tagging**: Assigns parts of speech to words in the text.
- **🌳 Dependency Parsing**: Analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences.
- **🧐 Topic Coherence**: Evaluates the quality of extracted topics.
