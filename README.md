# Generalized Analysis of Text Data

## Overview
This repo provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing text data using various AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It's designed to be a reference guide and inspiration for text analysis projects, offering insights into themes, sentiment, named entities, and more.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Uses the 20 Newsgroups dataset for demonstration.
- **Initial Textual Analysis**: Performs basic text statistics and word frequency analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes key aspects of the text data.
- **Topic Modeling**: Uncovers hidden thematic structures in the text corpus.
- **Text Clustering**: Groups similar documents using K-means clustering.
- **Word Embeddings**: Captures semantic relationships between words using Word2Vec.
- **Document Similarity**: Identifies related documents using cosine similarity.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Extracts and classifies named entities in the text.
- **Topic Network Visualization**: Visualizes relationships between topics and words.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of the text.
- **Text Classification**: Automatically categorizes texts using machine learning.
- **Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of longer texts.
- **POS Tagging**: Assigns parts of speech to words in the text.
- **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences.
- **Topic Coherence**: Evaluates the quality of extracted topics.
